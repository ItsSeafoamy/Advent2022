# Advent 2022
Solutions for Advent of Code 2022, provided by Github's Copilot

I gave myself the challenge this year of only using Copilot to solve all the puzzles, as such, the vast majority of the code was not written by me.  
An exception to this is the main Advent2022 class, which is used to read the input and then call the appropriate puzzle class.  
The puzzle inputs, all found in the resources folder, were all manually copied from the AoC website.

**Don't look at the code if you want to solve the puzzles yourself!**
